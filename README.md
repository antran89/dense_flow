This is a modified software to extract flows and frames from video datasets such as HMDB51, UCF101, Sports1M, ActivityNet and etc.
The original software from WangLimin's dense flow [codes](https://github.com/yjxiong/dense_flow).

Our software adds more types of optical flow including LDOF. We also provide Bash and Python script to run the program on whole dataset.
